> 📘 **A hands-on self-practice project** created during a foundational course on Python and Google Colab, designed as a gateway into Machine Learning.


## 📚 Course Overview

This repository showcases my code and practice from the **Udemy** course:  
**🎓 "Python with Google Colab – A Step to Machine Learning"**

> This course is completely practical-based and acts as a pre-requisite to upcoming Machine Learning modules. Built around Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook, it's packed with essential Python concepts and real-time execution—all in the cloud.  
>  
> 🔰 After completing this course, I now have a solid basic understanding of Python programming and how to use Google Colab effectively.
